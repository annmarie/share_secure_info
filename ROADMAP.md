## ROADMAP

### PRODUCT
* User friendly URLs
* Ability to create another secret after the "Your secret is ready to share" confirmation page
* Support text formatting on the opened URL/shared secret message page (e.g. in instructions if secret creator wrote 1, 2, 3 and pressed enter for it to be read in list format, when the secret message is opened, it can be read in list format)

### TECHNICAL
* Secret keys need to be encrypted before passing to the user 
* Add tests. We started to add tests but abandon that in the interest of time.
* Add linting. We didn't want to slow down the process.
* There is an issue in develoment mode where the styles break and you have to restart.  Does not seem to be a prod issue
